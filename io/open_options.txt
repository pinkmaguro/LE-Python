where meanings are: (just to avoid any misinterpretation)

read - reading from file is allowed
write - writing to file is allowed
create - file is created if it does not exist yet
trunctate - during opening of the file it is made empty (all content of the file is erased)
position at start - after file is opened, initial position is set to the start of the file
position at end - after file is opened, initial position is set to the end of the file
